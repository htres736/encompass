    <p>1. What is this?</p>
    <p>
      EnCoMPASS (ENC) is a software platform for gathering and looking closely
      at student work. Current projects include new student work as well as an
      extensive library of past student work.
    </p>
    <p>2. How is it used?</p>
    <p>It is used by individual teachers to look at their students’ work, by
      groups of in-service teachers looking at student work together, and in
      undergraduate and graduate education classes.
    </p>
    <p>3. Can I use it?</p>
    <p>Absolutely! An NSF-supported project is continuing the development of
      this software and it is free for anyone to use. Please contact
      encompass@drexel.edu for with questions or more information.</p>
    <p>4. What should I know before using it? </p>
    <p>
      It is a work in progress. While the software is stable enough for serious
      work, it is being constantly improved, both on the surface and behind the
      scenes. Our hope is a product that is able to run with minimal oversight.</p>

    <p>6. Can I use it for my own classes? </p>
    <p>
      Sure, whether you mean K-12 students who will be submitting work that you
      will then analyze using the software, or higher education classes that
      might both submit work and look close at that work together. You can learn
      more about having your K-12 students submit HERE, and learn about using it
      with higher ed classes HERE.
    </p>
    <p>7. What other professional opportunities are there through EnCoMPASS?
    </p>
    <p>
      While our current research cohorts are winding down this spring, we do
      have a monthly “Math Monday” where past project participants meet to talk
      about a problem and look at some student work together. You would be
      welcome to join us. just visit our Math Monday page. We have developing a
      version of our current workshop for use by groups of teachers, either
      under our direction or in a school or district, that we hope to have ready
      by Fall 2023. More information will be posted on our Professional
      Development page as it becomes available. You can also join our mailing
      list to get periodic updates on our offerings.
