  <h1>Mathematics teaching and learning looks different than it did a year ago.</h1>
  <p>And mathematics teaching and learning will likely never be the same. In the
    ORCIDS project, teachers, researchers and other math educators are focused
    on ways to engage more meaningfully with students online
  </p>
  <p>Together we are learning about selecting good tasks for doing math in a
    virtual context and developing strategies and experience with software
    designed to help us see, think about and build on students work. And its all
    designed to take place asynchronously â€” without the camera on.</p>
